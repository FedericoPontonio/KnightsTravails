The error doesn't get thrown properly with the current log setup.
The error handling could be more comprehensive, such as including the case of omitting coordinates.

The return of the knightMoves function could be set to be more convenient for different kind visualisation. One way could be setting up a variable with the returned object, so it can be manipulated without the need to be processed more than one time.
